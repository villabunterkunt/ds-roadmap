# What skills do I need to work on?

I tried to summarize some articles concerning the required skills for doing datascience. At frist, for the sake of completeness, I try to find a definition for "data science" or "data scientist". I will try to keep it short, because we all know how to google and definitions can be pretty boring. 
Afterwards I will try to outline the most important skills so I know what specific skills I should be working on.

## What is it?

Wikipedia says, that Data Science is defined as the extraction of knowledge or insights from data.
The data can be present in various forms. Data science includes aspects from many fields like mathematics, statistics, information science, computer science (machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases and visualization). [(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science "Wikipedia about Datascience")
datajobs.com [(2)](https://datajobs.com/what-is-data-science "What is datascience") says, that there are 2 main goals concerning data science. The first one is to gain insights and the second one is to develop a data product.

So a data scientist is someone who performs data science, is he/she?
"A data scientist is someone who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician." [(3)](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-scientist/ "The Life of a Data Scientist")

According to an article in the "faz" [(4)](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/beruf-chance/beruf/digitalisierung-was-macht-eigentlich-ein-data-scientist-14416564.html "Was macht ein Data Scientist") a Data Scientist is a point of intersection between pure domain knowledge and analytics. The main task of her/him is to translate data into understandable and productive instructions. It also states, domain knowledge, analytics and being a teamplayer are crucial.


## What do you need?

### technical skills

- R, Python

- visualization
- modeling
- "hacking"

### analytical skills

- statistics (classical, bayesian)
- maschine learning (predection, pattern discovery)
- geoanalytics
- optimization
- Mathematics (linear Algebra)
- algorithmic thinking
- data munging

### personal skills

- curiosity
- teamwork
- presentation
- communication skills
- translate data into stories 


## And now?

I've already got some skills in the area of programming and slightly touched the topic of machine learning in my past. That's why my focus for the next few weeks will be to refresh my knowledge in statistics. During my googeling I found a very interesting [learning plan](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/the-most-comprehensive-data-science-learning-plan-for-2017/ "The most comprehensive Data Science learning plan for 2017"), which I will try to follow or at least take as inspiration. 


Here are some of the articles I skimmed to get an overview about required skills:
