Consists of 5 Parts:

1. 5 Questions Data Science can answer
2. Is your data ready for data science?
3. Ask a question you can answer with data
4. Predict an answer with a simple model
5. Copy other people’s work to do data science

## 5 Questions Data Science can answer
The 5 questions + ways to answer them:

1. Is it A or B?

Classification algorithms

2. Is this weird?

Anomaly detection algorithms

3. How much - or - How many?

Regression algorithms

4. How is this organized?

Clustering algorithms

5. What should I do next?

Reinforcment learning algorithms

## Is your data ready for data science?

4 requirements:

* Relevant
there has to be a relationship

* Connected
not too many gaps in the data

* Accurate
mind: precice and accurate!
not too much scattering, "near the target"

* Enough to Work with
patterns need to be apparent

## Ask a question you can answer with data

* "sharp question"
* examples of the answer in the data necessary

Examples of the answer:

* target answer
* A or B: category
* How much/how many: regression
* Type of question is hint to used algorithm!

## Predict an answer with a simple model

Model = simplified story about our data

Simple example: Predict diamond price!

Draw a simple scatterplot with carates/prices + observe pattern. (Linear Regression: How much? Straight line.)

## Copy other people’s work to do data science

The title reminds me of the book "Steal like an artist" from 
Austion Kleon, which i wanted to read for a long time. :)

# Roundup

Pretty light and sweet introduction to datascience. Was fun to watch and a perfect way to get a restart to the topic.
